                <p> We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision.</p>

                <p>An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.</p>
                    
                <p>We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text.</p>
                    
                <p>You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. You’re disgusting.</p>
                    
                <p>I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.</p>
